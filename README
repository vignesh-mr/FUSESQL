This is a project which tries to integrate the concept of a VFS and a debugger's main function -- viewing the live state variables and the details of the program.

This project uses fuse and fuse-python bindings to create and mount a VFS.
At present the code must be added manually to save the current state of the variables, modules etc.



This is just version 0.0.1

Future Enhancements

Must add the code such that as the program is being executed the program state is updated periodically and visible as a text file.
Must add code such the structure of the classes defined is shown in an heirarchical manner.



Usage

python somefile.py mountpoint

the test file is test.py
